//TODO Create a menu app as seen in this weekâ€™s video. What you create is up to you as long as it meets the following requirements:
//* Use at least one array.
//* Use at least two classes.
//* Your menu should have the options to create, view, and delete elements.

//this class is the blueprint for car, a new car can be created using this class

// let car2 = new Car("ford", "explorer");
// console.log(car1, car2);
